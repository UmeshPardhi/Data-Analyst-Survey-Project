Data-Analyst-Survey-Project

OBJECTIVE: 
	To perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the StackOverflow developer survey dataset. The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow for the year 2022.
	The main objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns.

TOOLS USED:
	Python3
	NumPy 
	pandas 
	matplotlib

INFERENCES and CONCLUSION:
	1. Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.

	2. The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.

	3. Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.

	4. A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.

	5. Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.

	6. Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.

	7. Rust and TypeScript are the most "loved" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.

	8. Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.

	9. You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.
